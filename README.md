# odin-recipes
This is the recipes project from The Odin Project curriculum. It's also for me to learn more about coding conventions and good practices for setting up a git repository.

The website is pretty simple - a homepage and three linked recipe pages involving images and lists. You can view it locally or see the published version at [here](https://gouda64.github.io/odin-recipes/).
